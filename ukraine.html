        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p><a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/en">Ukraine</a> was the center of the first eastern Slavic state, Kyivan Rus, which during the 10th and 11th centuries was the largest and most powerful state in Europe. Weakened by internecine quarrels and Mongol invasions, Kyivan Rus was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and eventually into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The cultural and religious legacy of Kyivan Rus laid the foundation for Ukrainian nationalism through subsequent centuries.</p>

        <p>A new Ukrainian state, the Cossack Hetmanate, was established during the mid-17th century after an uprising against the Poles. Despite continuous Muscovite pressure, the Hetmanate managed to remain autonomous for well over 100 years. During the latter part of the 18th century, most Ukrainian ethnographic territory was absorbed by the Russian Empire.</p>

        <p>Following the collapse of czarist Russia in <time datetime="1917">1917</time>, Ukraine achieved a short-lived period of independence (1917-20), but was reconquered and endured a brutal Soviet rule that engineered two forced famines (1921-22 and 1932-33) in which over 8 million died. In World War II, German and Soviet armies were responsible for 7 to 8 million more deaths. Although Ukraine achieved independence in <time datetime="1991">1991</time> with the dissolution of the (<abbr title="Union of Soviet Socialist Republics">USSR</abbr>), democracy and prosperity remained elusive as the legacy of state control and endemic corruption stalled efforts at economic reform, privatization, and civil liberties.</p>

        <p>A peaceful mass protest referred to as the "Orange Revolution" in the closing months of <time datetime="2004">2004</time> forced the authorities to overturn a rigged presidential election and to allow a new internationally monitored vote that swept into power a reformist slate under Viktor YUSHCHENKO. Subsequent internal squabbles in the YUSHCHENKO camp allowed his rival Viktor YANUKOVYCH to stage a comeback in parliamentary (Rada) elections, become prime minister in <time datetime="2006-08">August 2006</time>, and be elected president in <time datetime="2010-02">February 2010</time>. In <time datetime="2012-10">October 2012</time>, Ukraine held Rada elections, widely criticized by Western observers as flawed due to use of government resources to favor ruling party candidates, interference with media access, and harassment of opposition candidates.</p>

        <p>President YANUKOVYCH's backtracking on a trade and cooperation agreement with the (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) in <time datetime="2013-11">November 2013</time> - in favor of closer economic ties with Russia - and subsequent use of force against students, civil society activists, and other civilians in favor of the agreement led to a three-month protest occupation of Kyiv's central square. The government's use of violence to break up the protest camp in <time datetime="2014-02">February 2014</time> led to all out pitched battles, scores of deaths, international condemnation, a failed political deal, and the president's abrupt departure for Russia. New elections in the spring allowed pro-West president Petro POROSHENKO to assume office in <time datetime="2014-06">June 2014</time>; he was succeeded by Volodymyr ZELENSKY in <time datetime="2019-05">May 2019</time>.</p>

        <p>Shortly after YANUKOVYCH's departure in late <time datetime="2014-02">February 2014</time>, Russian President PUTIN ordered the invasion of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula falsely claiming the action was to protect ethnic Russians living there. Two weeks later, a "referendum" was held regarding the integration of Crimea into the Russian Federation. The "referendum" was condemned as illegitimate by the Ukrainian Government, the (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>), the (<abbr title="United States">US</abbr>), and the (<abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr>) General Assembly (UNGA). In response to Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, 100 members of the (<abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr>) passed (<abbr title="United Nations General Assembly">UNGA</abbr>) resolution 68/262, rejecting the "referendum" as baseless and invalid and confirming the sovereignty, political independence, unity, and territorial integrity of Ukraine.</p>

        <p>In mid-<time datetime="2014">August 2014</time>, Russia began supplying proxies in two of Ukraine's eastern provinces with manpower, funding, and materiel driving an armed conflict with the Ukrainian Government that continues to this day. Representatives from Ukraine, Russia, and the unrecognized Russian proxy republics signed the Minsk Protocol and Memorandum in <time datetime="2014-09">September 2014</time> to end the conflict. However, this agreement failed to stop the fighting or find a political solution.</p>

        <p>In a renewed attempt to alleviate ongoing clashes, leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France, and Germany negotiated a follow-on Package of Measures in <time datetime="2015-02">February 2015</time> to implement the Minsk agreements. Representatives from Ukraine, Russia, the unrecognized Russian proxy republics, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe also meet regularly to facilitate implementation of the peace deal. More than 14,000 civilians have been killed or wounded as a result of the Russian intervention in eastern Ukraine.</p>
