      <h2>Shawn</h2>
        <h3>Shawn is a versatile guard that can play off the ball or create his own shot. He has a strong mid range and a developing 3 point shot and is known as one of the best defensive players in the Kendall Parks League.</h3>
        <h3>Conclusion: You do not want Shawn guarding you because it will be a tough game, and don't sleep on his offensive power because he will shoot the ball.</h3>
