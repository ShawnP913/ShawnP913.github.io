        <h2>About Me</h2>

          <p>I am a 19 year old student who is studying Computer Science at the University of Miami and working as a Vehicle Condition Accessor at Carmax. When I am not at school or work, I enjoy trading derivatives in the stock market, working out, and driving cars.</p>

        <h3>Ambitons</h3>

          <p> My ambitions are to develop my skills in computer science and the stock market to be able to trade full time, using my CS skills to fine tune my strategies and create custom software to gain an edge on the market. </p>
